                <h4>ABOUT ME:</h4>
                <p>A passionate and young developer that is currently exploring the wonders of web development and designing. In 2018, I graduated with a degree major in Theoretical Physics in Nanyang Technological University. Shortly after graduation, I obtained an internship program with a company called Excide, where i got to learn Ruby on Rails framework and incorporating APIs into softwares. </p>
                <p>In September 2018, I enrolled into General Assembly Singapore, to undergo an intensive <i>Web Development Immersive program</i> for 12 weeks. In these 12 weeks, I learnt how to make basic front end development(HTML, CSS, JavaScript), backend development(SQL, NodeJS framework) and full stack framework such as Ruby on Rails. Throughout this course, I have also tried many designing libraries such as bootstrap, semantic UI and reactJS to optimize the user interface/user experience of the web.</p>
                <p>My interest in coding and web developing comes from my final year project (Titled: <i>A study of the usefulness of technology in enhancing 3D imagination and thinking for selected physics courses</i>). Throughout my final year, I was exposed to C# scripting with Unity3D software, where I've tried to design and code virtual reality program for physics education curriculum. I learn that there are many things I could do through coding, technologies and the technical skills, and hence I decided to pursue an IT career. </p>

                <h5>Project 4: Rent Out Loud</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Project 4 is an E-commerce app, that allows people to rent out their board game with a small weekly cost. This encourages people to have great family time with affordable cost(as compared to buying the board game yourself, which can be costly).</p>
                <p>Many gems were used in this project, such as acts_as_vatable, dotenv, devise, cloudinary, stripe, geocoder and many more. The main framework of this project is Ruby On Rails, with decorative Bootstrap. This project is also mobile responsive so that people can do transaction on their phone</p>
                <p>This project also enforces cashless transaction, through the use of Stripe API. When the order is created, an email confirmation would be sent out to the customer, through the use of Rails ActionMailer.</p>

                <h5>Project 3: Stack BananaFlow</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Project 3 is a group management project whereby it is done by groups of 3-4 people. In this project, the idea is to allow programmers (beginner or expert) to form a community through asking questions and  allowing to upvote or downvotes. This idea is inspired by stack overflow and it is meant to be for learning purposes. </p>

                <h5>Project 2: Book Xchange</h5>
                <br>
                <p>This project seeks to convey the idea that exchanging books not only saves the environment by cutting down production of paper, but also enriches the habit of reading. The project is done using NodeJS, ExpressJS and Postgres database.</p>
                <p>Reader will be able to post their favourite book onto the app, and give it a description review. Other readers will then be able to see the post, comment and arrange for a date to exchange books.</p>

                <h5>Project 1: Journey to the culinary world!</h5>
                <br>
                <p>A matching game designed using pure HTML, CSS and Javascript. Players are required to match the ingredients to obtain the recipe. Here's the catch: players can only match the ingredients listed in the recipe on the right, and a 15 seconds timer was put there to increase the challenge of this game. After successfully completing level 1, players will then move on to another level (another dish). This is a fun and challenging game with delicious food as motivation</p>
